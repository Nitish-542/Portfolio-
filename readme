# Nitish Sharma's Portfolio 

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built using **Vite + React**. This project showcases my skills, experience, and featured projects by dynamically fetching data from a Node.js + Express backend.

> ⚠️ Note: This repository contains **only the frontend code**. The backend API is hosted separately.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- React (with Vite)
- React Bootstrap
- Axios
- Responsive Design

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.13 or above)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nitish-542/Portfolio.git
   cd Portfolio
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000

> ✅ Make sure the backend server (hosted or local) is running and accessible for full functionality.

## 🔗 API Configuration

This React app uses an external backend API. To configure the API URL, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```
